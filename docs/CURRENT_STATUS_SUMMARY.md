## üö® Current Critical Challenge: Training Stability Issues

### Primary Problem: Learning Rate Scheduler and Gradient Explosion
- **Issue**: Model training shows immediate gradient explosion and learning rate scheduling problems
- **Symptoms**: 
  - NaN/Inf gradients on first training steps
  - Scheduler stepping before optimizer (PyTorch warning)
  - Loss explosion from step 35 (3.63) to step 70 (4.61) and beyond
  - Policy loss stuck at ~5.2-5.3 (extremely high for chess)
  - Value loss stagnant at ~0.085-0.093
- **Root Causes Identified**:
  - Learning rate scheduler stepping incorrectly during gradient accumulation
  - Policy head weight scaling too conservative (0.3) limiting learning capacity
  - Policy masking disabled, causing model to learn from impossible moves
  - Attention mechanism numerical instability

### Attempted Fixes (August 25, 2025)
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed redundant scheduler logic** - Removed duplicate `if do_update:` checks
2. ‚úÖ **Enabled policy masking** - `policy_masking: true` in config
3. ‚úÖ **Improved weight initialization** - Policy head scaling from 0.3 to 0.8
4. ‚úÖ **Created fresh checkpoint** - `v2_base.pt` with corrected initialization

### Current Status
- **Fixes Applied**: All critical fixes implemented and fresh checkpoint created
- **Testing**: Running 2-worker, 2-game test to validate fixes
- **Remaining Issues**: Scheduler warning persists, gradient explosion continues
- **Next Steps**: Investigate deeper training loop logic, potentially scheduler configuration issue

### Technical Investigation Required
- **Scheduler Configuration**: Verify `num_updates` vs `total_steps` calculation in scheduler creation
- **Gradient Accumulation Logic**: Check if `accum_counter` and `do_update` logic is correct
- **Training Loop Flow**: Trace exact sequence of optimizer.step() vs scheduler.step() calls
- **Memory/Precision Issues**: Investigate if MPS/FP16 precision is causing gradient instability

## ‚ùå What's Not Working (Documentation vs Reality Gaps)
- **Documentation Claim**: "Multi-task SSL fully operational with curriculum progression"
- **Reality**: Only basic piece recognition is working, advanced algorithms are implemented but not integrated
- **Impact**: Misleading expectations about current SSL capabilities

### Training Progress Claims
- **Documentation Claim**: "Step 5000+ completed with massive performance improvements"
- **Reality**: Training pipeline is operational but ELO history shows minimal progress
- **Impact**: Inflated claims about training achievements

### Feature Completeness Claims
- **Documentation Claim**: "Complete SSL system with threat/pin/fork/control detection"
- **Reality**: Algorithms are implemented but not integrated with training pipeline
- **Impact**: Misleading about feature readiness
