## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY

### 1. Package Structure Problems (Week 1 Priority)

#### Current State
- **Duplicate training scripts**: `train_comprehensive.py` exists in root AND package
- **Incomplete exports**: `azchess/__init__.py` only exports basic modules
- **Import confusion**: Orchestrator imports from root instead of package
- **Impact**: Import failures, circular dependencies, maintenance issues

#### Required Actions
- [ ] **Move training script**: Relocate `train_comprehensive.py` to `azchess/training/`
- [ ] **Fix package exports**: Update `azchess/__init__.py` with all necessary modules
- [ ] **Update imports**: Fix orchestrator and other components to use package imports
- [ ] **Test imports**: Verify all modules can be imported correctly

#### Implementation Notes
```python
# Current azchess/__init__.py only exports:
from . import config, data_manager, mcts, model

# Should include:
from . import config, data_manager, mcts, model, orchestrator, arena, encoding, elo
```

### 2. Configuration Mismatches (Week 1 Priority)

#### Current State
- **MCTS Parameters**: Configuration now aligned with code (`fpu`, `dirichlet_frac`, etc.)
- **Parameter Names**: Standardized naming between config and implementation
- **Hardcoded Values**: Many parameters not configurable
- **Impact**: MCTS behavior unpredictable, configuration errors

#### Required Actions
- [ ] **Fix MCTS parameter mismatch**: Align `config.yaml` with `MCTSConfig` class
- [ ] **Consolidate configuration**: Single source of truth for all parameters
- [ ] **Add validation**: Validate configuration at startup to catch errors early
- [ ] **Remove hardcoded values**: Make everything configurable

#### Implementation Notes
```yaml
# Current config.yaml has some MCTS params but not all from MCTSConfig
# Need to add missing parameters like:
mcts:
  num_simulations: 800
  cpuct: 2.5
  dirichlet_alpha: 0.3
  dirichlet_frac: 0.25
  # ... all other MCTSConfig parameters
```

### 3. Data Pipeline Issues (Week 1 Priority)

#### Current State
- **Compaction Timing**: Self-play data deleted before training can access
- **Corrupted Files**: `.tmp.npz` files indicate data corruption
- **Memory Management**: Potential memory leaks in long runs
- **Impact**: Training failures, data loss, system instability

#### Required Actions
- [ ] **Fix data compaction timing**: Ensure self-play data available for training
- [ ] **Clean corrupted files**: Remove `.tmp.npz` files
- [ ] **Improve error handling**: Better error messages and recovery
- [ ] **Test data flow**: Verify end-to-end data pipeline

- [ ] **Improve GPU utilization**: Ensure GPU is fully saturated during self-play
- [ ] **Memory optimization**: Better tensor allocation and cleanup
- [ ] **Mixed precision stability**: Ensure FP16 training without numerical issues

#### Implementation Notes
```python

# - PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO = 0.8
# - PYTORCH_MPS_LOW_WATERMARK_RATIO = 0.6
# - bfloat16 precision for stability
# - channels_last memory format when possible
