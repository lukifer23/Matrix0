# GRPO Chess AI Experiment Design

## 1. Vision & Objectives

Transform Matrix0 into a cutting-edge research platform by integrating GRPO (Generalized Reward-based Policy Optimization) with advanced transformer architectures. This experimental framework will explore novel RL techniques while maintaining the safety and stability of the main Matrix0 system.

### Core Research Questions

1.  **Can GRPO achieve better sample efficiency than PPO in chess?**
2.  **Do transformers with advanced attention capture chess patterns better than CNNs?**
3.  **What is the optimal group size for GRPO in chess?**
4.  **How does the performance of GRPO scale with model size?**

## 2. GRPO Algorithm Overview

### Core Principles

GRPO (Generalized Reward-based Policy Optimization) is a recent RL algorithm that:

1.  **Group-based Reward Normalization**: Uses a group of trajectories to normalize rewards, reducing variance.
2.  **Sparse Reward Optimization**: Designed for environments with sparse, delayed rewards like chess.
3.  **Variable-length Sequence Handling**: Robust to sequences of different lengths.

### Mathematical Foundation

**Standard PPO Loss:**

```
L_PPO = E[min(ρ_t(θ)A_t, clip(ρ_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)A_t)]
```

**GRPO Loss with Group Normalization:**

```
L_GRPO = E[1/G * Σ_{i=1}^G (A_t^i / σ_group) * min(ρ_t(θ)A_t^i, clip(ρ_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)A_t^i)]
```

Where:

-   `G` = group size for reward normalization
-   `σ_group` = standard deviation of rewards within the group
-   `A_t^i` = advantage for trajectory i at timestep t

## 3. Experimental Architecture

### Components

-   **MCTS Engine**: A robust MCTS implementation for trajectory generation.
-   **Neural Network**: A transformer-based architecture (`MagnusChessTransformer`).
-   **Training Pipeline**: A GRPO-based training pipeline.
-   **Orchestrator**: A script to manage the self-play, training, and evaluation cycle.

### Experimental Setup

**Control Group (PPO + ResNet):**

-   The existing PPO implementation in the main `Matrix0` codebase will serve as the baseline for comparison.

**Experimental Group (GRPO + Transformer):**

-   **Medium Transformer**: 6-layer transformer with 384-dimensional embeddings and 6 attention heads (~25M parameters).
-   **Large Transformer**: 12-layer transformer with 512-dimensional embeddings and 8 attention heads (~70M parameters).

### Metrics

-   Win rate vs. baseline.
-   Sample efficiency (performance per game).
-   Training stability (loss variance).
-   Computational requirements.

## 4. Risk Management

### Technical Risks

-   **Training Instability:** Gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling are implemented to mitigate this.
-   **MCTS Hangs:** Timeouts are implemented in the MCTS search to prevent hangs.
-   **Performance Regression:** Regular baseline comparisons will be performed to detect any performance regressions.

### Rollback Plan

-   If the GRPO experiments show significant performance regressions or instability, we will halt the experiments and revert to the main PPO-based training pipeline.

## 5. Future Research Directions

-   **Meta-Learning:** Adaptive parameter tuning based on game state and performance.
-   **Reward Shaping:** Incorporating chess-specific domain knowledge into the reward function.
-   **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining GRPO with other techniques like self-supervised learning (SSL).
