## 2. GRPO Algorithm Overview

### Core Principles
GRPO (Generalized Reward-based Policy Optimization) is a recent RL algorithm that:

1. **Group-based Reward Normalization**: Uses a group of trajectories to normalize rewards, reducing variance
2. **Sparse Reward Optimization**: Designed for environments with sparse, delayed rewards
3. **Variable-length Sequence Handling**: Robust to sequences of different lengths
4. **Sample Efficiency**: Potentially more efficient than traditional PPO in sparse reward settings

### Mathematical Foundation

**Standard PPO Loss:**
```
L_PPO = E[min(ρ_t(θ)A_t, clip(ρ_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)A_t)]
```

**GRPO Loss with Group Normalization:**
```
L_GRPO = E[1/G * Σ_{i=1}^G (A_t^i / σ_group) * min(ρ_t(θ)A_t^i, clip(ρ_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)A_t^i)]
```

Where:
- `G` = group size for reward normalization
- `σ_group` = standard deviation of rewards within the group
- `A_t^i` = advantage for trajectory i at timestep t

### Why GRPO for Chess?

**Sparse Rewards Match:**
- Chess provides rewards only at game end (+1/0/-1)
- GRPO's reward normalization helps credit assignment over 50-180+ moves
- Reduces variance in long-horizon learning

**Sequence Length Handling:**
- Games vary significantly in length
- GRPO handles variable-length trajectories naturally
- Better than fixed-length assumptions in traditional RL

**Sample Efficiency Potential:**
- Current PPO requires extensive MCTS rollouts
- GRPO's group normalization might learn faster from same data
- Could reduce computational requirements

        self.group_size = group_size
        self.clip_epsilon = clip_epsilon

    def compute_group_normalized_advantage(self, trajectories):
        """Compute advantages with group-based reward normalization"""
        # Group trajectories by similar reward characteristics
        # Normalize advantages within each group
        # Return group-normalized advantages
        pass

    def grpo_loss(self, old_logprobs, new_logprobs, advantages):
        """Compute GRPO loss with clipping and group normalization"""
        # Implement GRPO loss function
        # Include group-based reward normalization
        pass
```
