# GRPO Chess AI Experiment Plan

## üéØ **Vision & Objectives**

Transform Matrix0 into a cutting-edge research platform by integrating GRPO (Generalized Reward-based Policy Optimization) with advanced transformer architectures. This experimental framework will explore novel RL techniques while maintaining the safety and stability of the main Matrix0 system.

### **Core Research Questions**
1. **Can GRPO achieve better sample efficiency than PPO in chess?**
2. **Do transformers with advanced attention capture chess patterns better than CNNs?**
3. **What role does meta-learning play in chess RL?**
4. **How do different reward shaping techniques affect learning dynamics?**
5. **What's the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in chess?**
